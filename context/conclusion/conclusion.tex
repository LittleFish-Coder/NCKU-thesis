This thesis presents GemGNN (Generative Multi-view Interaction Graph Neural Networks), a novel framework for few-shot fake news detection that addresses fundamental limitations of existing approaches through content-based graph neural network modeling enhanced with generative auxiliary data and rigorous evaluation protocols.

\section{Summary of Contributions}

Our work establishes several key contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in few-shot fake news detection:

\textbf{Generative User Interaction Simulation:} We introduce the first approach to synthesize realistic user interactions using Large Language Models (LLMs) for fake news detection. By leveraging Gemini to generate diverse user responses with multiple emotional tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical), our method eliminates the dependency on real user propagation data while maintaining the benefits of interaction-based modeling. This innovation enables deployment in privacy-constrained scenarios where social data is unavailable.

\textbf{Test-Isolated KNN Edge Construction:} We develop a novel graph construction strategy that prevents information leakage between test nodes through strict isolation constraints. This approach ensures more realistic evaluation by prohibiting test nodes from connecting to each other, addressing a critical flaw in existing graph-based few-shot learning methods that leads to overly optimistic performance estimates.

\textbf{Multi-View Graph Architecture:} We propose a multi-view learning framework that partitions news embeddings into multiple semantic perspectives, enabling the model to capture diverse aspects of news content. Each view constructs its own graph structure, and multiple graphs are trained simultaneously to provide comprehensive data augmentation at the graph level.

\textbf{Enhanced Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks:} We design a specialized HAN-based architecture that effectively models complex relationships between news articles and generated user interactions through type-specific attention mechanisms and hierarchical aggregation strategies. Our transductive learning approach maximizes the utility of unlabeled data in few-shot scenarios.

\textbf{Comprehensive Evaluation Framework:} We establish rigorous experimental protocols that ensure fair comparison with existing methods while maintaining realistic few-shot learning constraints. Our evaluation spans multiple datasets, baseline categories, and statistical significance testing to provide reliable performance assessments.

\section{Key Findings and Insights}

Our comprehensive experimental evaluation reveals several important insights about few-shot fake news detection:

\textbf{Graph Structure Effectiveness:} Heterogeneous graph structures provide substantial benefits over independent document processing in few-shot scenarios. The ability to propagate information from limited labeled examples to unlabeled instances through graph connectivity is crucial for achieving strong performance with minimal supervision.

\textbf{Generative Data Augmentation Value:} LLM-generated user interactions provide meaningful signal for fake news detection, with different interaction tones (neutral, affirmative, skeptical) contributing complementary information. Skeptical interactions show particularly high discriminative power for identifying misinformation.

\textbf{Test Isolation Importance:} The test-isolated KNN strategy is critical for realistic evaluation, with removal of this constraint leading to the largest performance drop (-0.07 F1-score) among all ablated components. This finding highlights the importance of preventing information leakage in few-shot learning evaluation.

\textbf{Multi-View Benefits:} The multi-view approach captures diverse semantic perspectives that improve model robustness and generalization. By forcing the model to learn from multiple similarity views, we achieve more stable performance across different types of news content.

\textbf{Transductive Learning Advantages:} The transductive learning paradigm effectively leverages unlabeled data to improve feature representation in few-shot scenarios. Including all nodes in message passing while restricting loss computation to labeled nodes maximizes information utilization.

\section{Implications for Fake News Detection}

Our work has several important implications for the broader field of fake news detection:

\textbf{Privacy-Preserving Detection:} By eliminating dependency on user behavior data, our approach enables fake news detection in scenarios where privacy regulations or platform restrictions prevent access to social information. This capability is increasingly important as privacy concerns grow and data access becomes more restricted.

\textbf{Real-Time Deployment:} The content-based nature of our approach enables real-time fake news detection without waiting for propagation patterns to develop. This capability is crucial for identifying misinformation in its early stages before it can spread widely.

\textbf{Cross-Domain Generalization:} Our framework demonstrates consistent performance across different news domains (political vs. entertainment), suggesting that the learned representations capture general misinformation patterns rather than domain-specific artifacts.

\textbf{Few-Shot Practicality:} The strong performance in few-shot scenarios makes our approach practical for detecting misinformation about emerging topics or novel events where extensive labeled data is not available.

\textbf{Synthetic Data Integration:} Our successful integration of LLM-generated auxiliary data opens new directions for incorporating synthetic information to enhance detection systems while maintaining evaluation integrity.

\section{Limitations and Challenges}

Despite the significant advances presented in this work, several limitations and challenges remain:

\textbf{Embedding Dependency:} Our approach's performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of the underlying DeBERTa embeddings. While these representations capture rich semantic information, they may miss subtle linguistic patterns or domain-specific indicators that human fact-checkers would recognize.

\textbf{Sophisticated Misinformation:} Highly sophisticated fake news that closely mimics legitimate journalism style can still challenge our approach, particularly when the content contains accurate peripheral information with subtle factual distortions that are difficult to detect through content analysis alone.

\textbf{LLM Generation Costs:} While the one-time cost of generating user interactions can be amortized across multiple experiments, the computational expense of LLM inference may limit scalability to very large datasets or frequent retraining scenarios.

\textbf{Static Graph Limitation:} Our current approach constructs static graphs based on pre-computed embeddings, which may not capture dynamic relationships that evolve as new information becomes available or as the understanding of news events develops.

\textbf{Evaluation Dataset Size:} The relatively small size of available fake news datasets limits our ability to conduct more extensive few-shot experiments with larger support sets or more diverse evaluation scenarios.

\textbf{Interpretability Challenges:} While our approach provides some interpretability through attention mechanisms, understanding exactly how the model makes decisions remains challenging, particularly for the complex interactions between multiple graph views and heterogeneous node types.

\section{Future Research Directions}

Our work opens several promising avenues for future research in few-shot fake news detection and related areas:

\textbf{Advanced LLM Integration:} Future work could explore more sophisticated integration of large language models, including fine-tuning specialized LLMs for interaction generation, exploring different LLM architectures, and investigating multi-modal LLMs for comprehensive content analysis.

\textbf{Dynamic Graph Construction:} Developing dynamic graph construction methods that can adapt as new information becomes available, including online learning algorithms, temporal modeling, and adaptive similarity measures.

\textbf{Improved Few-Shot Learning:} Advancing few-shot learning capabilities through meta-learning approaches, contrastive learning methods, and active learning strategies for optimal example selection.

\textbf{Multi-Modal Extensions:} Extending our approach to handle multi-modal content by incorporating visual features, developing cross-modal attention mechanisms, and creating unified representations for text and visual information.

\textbf{Robustness and Security:} Enhancing robustness against adversarial attacks through adversarial training, AI-generated text detection, and ensemble methods for improved reliability.

\textbf{Real-World Deployment:} Addressing practical deployment challenges including efficient inference algorithms, interpretable explanations, and evaluation frameworks that reflect real-world scenarios.

In conclusion, this thesis presents a significant advancement in few-shot fake news detection through the novel GemGNN framework. By addressing fundamental limitations of existing approaches and establishing new paradigms for content-based detection, our work provides a foundation for more effective and practical misinformation detection systems. The insights and methodologies developed here not only advance the current state-of-the-art but also open numerous directions for future research that can further enhance our ability to combat the growing threat of misinformation in digital media.
