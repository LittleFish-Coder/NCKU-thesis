\section*{Abstract}
    \label{sec:abstract}
    Fake news detection traditionally relies on user propagation patterns, but such data is increasingly difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns and sophisticated evasion tactics. We address this challenge by proposing DynGraph-GAT, a novel framework that operates solely on news content without requiring user interaction data. Our approach introduces dynamic threshold graph construction that adaptively determines edge connections based on semantic similarity statistics, overcoming limitations of fixed-topology methods. 
    
    We specifically target few-shot learning scenarios (3-16 samples per class) that reflect real-world constraints in emerging topics and resource-limited communities. DynGraph-GAT combines RoBERTa embeddings with Graph Attention Networks, enabling effective representation learning from limited examples through neighborhood message passing. 
    
    Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (PolitiFact and GossipCop) demonstrate that our framework achieves 0.67 F1-score with only 3 samples per class, outperforming traditional approaches by 6.8\% F1-score. Analysis reveals three key insights: (1) semantic relationships between news items contain sufficient signals for authenticity verification, (2) adaptive edge construction improves graph signal propagation in sparse data settings, and (3) content-centric approaches can match propagation-dependent methods while offering greater privacy protection.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
The rise of social media has transformed the way information is disseminated, enabling the rapid spread of fake news. This misinformation poses significant societal challenges, influencing public opinion, political processes, and even public health. Detecting fake news has become a critical task, but it faces several key challenges.

One major issue is the reliance on user propagation data in traditional fake news detection systems. These methods often leverage user interactions, sharing patterns, or social network structures to identify misinformation. While effective in some scenarios, these approaches face limitations due to privacy concerns, incomplete user data, and adversarial tactics by malicious actors who deliberately avoid social engagement to evade detection.

Another challenge is the scarcity of labeled data for emerging topics or low-resource domains. Many real-world scenarios lack sufficient annotated samples for supervised learning, making it difficult for traditional machine learning models to generalize effectively. Few-shot learning techniques have gained attention as a solution to this problem by enabling models to perform well with minimal labeled data.

Content-based fake news detection offers an alternative approach by focusing solely on the textual content of news articles. Early methods utilized lexical features (e.g., TF-IDF) combined with machine learning classifiers like MLPs but struggled to capture contextual relationships. Advances in deep learning introduced sequence-based models such as RNNs and LSTMs, which improved context understanding but faced limitations with long-range dependencies. The advent of pre-trained language models like BERT and RoBERTa revolutionized the field by providing deep semantic representations of text, yet these models often treat each document independently, missing inter-document relationships crucial for identifying systematic misinformation patterns.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising solution by modeling relationships between content elements. Propagation-based GNNs construct user-news interaction graphs but require extensive social data that may not always be available. Content-based GNNs, such as Text-GCN and BertGCN, address this limitation by modeling documents and words as nodes in a graph. However, these methods often rely on static graph structures or fail to capture direct relationships between news articles.


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\textbf{MLP-based Methods:} Early fake news detection approaches combined traditional machine learning paradigms with linguistic features extracted through TF-IDF, lexical analysis, and statistical patterns. These features were typically fed into Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for classification. While computationally efficient, these methods proved inadequate against semantically coherent fake news that mimics legitimate writing styles, as they failed to capture complex contextual relationships between words and concepts.

\textbf{Sequence-based Methods:} To improve text understanding, researchers introduced sequential modeling approaches. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) modeled news as word sequences, capturing contextual dependencies that MLP models missed. However, vanilla RNNs\cite{sherstinsky2020fundamentals} struggled with long documents due to the vanishing gradient problem. LSTM and GRU variants improved long-term dependency modeling but remained limited to unidirectional context. Hierarchical Attention Networks enhanced performance through sentence-level modeling but still processed each document in isolation, missing inter-document relationships crucial for distinguishing systematic misinformation patterns.

\textbf{Language Model-based Methods:} The advent of pre-trained language models revolutionized text analysis. BERT \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1810-04805}, through its bidirectional Transformer architecture, achieved deep semantic understanding by contextualizing each word based on its entire surrounding context. This approach effectively captured nuanced language patterns associated with misinformation. RoBERTa further optimized BERT's training process by removing the next sentence prediction task and using larger data volumes, achieving superior performance across NLP tasks. Despite their effectiveness, these models typically process news in isolation, treating each document as an independent sample rather than part of an interconnected information ecosystem.

\textbf{Graph Neural Network Methods:} Most recently, GNNs have emerged as powerful tools for fake news detection by modeling relationships between content elements. Existing GNN approaches fall into two categories: (1) propagation-based methods that construct user--news interaction graphs---effective but requiring extensive social data unavailable in privacy-sensitive or early-detection scenarios, and (2) content-based methods like Text-GCN and BertGCN that model documents and words as nodes in a homogeneous graph but miss direct relationships between news samples. Our work extends the latter approach with dynamic threshold construction algorithms and GAT-enhanced message passing specifically tailored for low-resource scenarios.

Unlike existing approaches, our method completely eliminates dependency on user data or external knowledge while maintaining the structural benefits of GNNs. The proposed DynGraph-GAT operates exclusively on content-derived relationships, establishing a new direction for privacy-preserving fake news detection in few-shot learning contexts.


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Our framework, DynGraph-GAT, addresses fake news detection through a graph-based approach that operates exclusively on news content without requiring user propagation data. We formulate fake news detection as a few-shot learning problem with N-way-K-shot configuration, where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item N = 2 classes (real news labeled as 0, fake news labeled as 1)
    \item K = 3-16 samples per class (e.g., 8-shot means 8 real + 8 fake news examples)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preliminaries}
Let \( G = (V, E) \) represent our content-based news graph where each node \( v_i \in V \) corresponds to a news document encoded through a pre-trained RoBERTa encoder. The node features matrix \( X \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d} \) contains RoBERTa embeddings with dimension \( d=768 \). For few-shot learning scenarios, we maintain \( n \) labeled nodes per class (\( n \in \{3,4,...,16\} \)) with binary labels \( y_i \in \{0,1\} \) indicating real (0) or fake (1) news. Our objective is to learn a graph neural network \( f_\theta: G \rightarrow [0,1]^N \) that predicts node labels through semi-supervised node classification.

\subsection{Node Representation Learning}
Each news document is encoded as a node in our graph using RoBERTa embeddings \cite{liu2019roberta}:
\begin{equation}
x_i = \text{RoBERTa}(d_i)^{[\text{CLS}]}
\end{equation}
where \( d_i \) denotes the raw text of news document \( i \), and \( [\text{CLS}] \) token embedding captures document-level semantics.

\subsection{Dynamic Threshold Edge Construction}
Unlike traditional KNN approaches that use a fixed number of neighbors, we propose a dynamic threshold strategy that adapts to the semantic similarity distribution in the dataset. The algorithm:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculates global similarity statistics across document embeddings
    \item Sets a threshold based on the mean and standard deviation of similarities
    \item Creates edges between documents with similarity exceeding this threshold
\end{itemize}

Specifically, the threshold is defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \tau = \mu + \alpha\sigma
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the mean similarity, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation, and $\alpha$ is a hyperparameter controlling threshold strictness (default $\alpha=0.5$).

This approach offers three key advantages over fixed-KNN: (1) it adapts to varying dataset densities, (2) prevents hub nodes with excessive connections, and (3) preserves natural community structures in the semantic space.

\subsection{Graph Attention Networks}
For node classification, we employ a Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture \cite{velivckovic2017graph} that learns attention weights between connected nodes:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha_{ij} = \frac{\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i\|\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j]))}{\sum_{k\in\mathcal{N}_i}\exp(\text{LeakyReLU}(\mathbf{a}^T[\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_i\|\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_k]))}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{h}_i^{(l+1)} = \sigma\left(\sum_{j\in\mathcal{N}_i}\alpha_{ij}\mathbf{W}\mathbf{h}_j^{(l)}\right)
\end{equation}

where $\mathbf{h}_i$ is the feature vector of node $i$, $\mathcal{N}_i$ is its neighborhood, and $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ are learnable parameters. Our implementation uses multi-head attention (8 heads) in the first layer and a single head in the output layer.

\subsection{Transductive Learning and Loss Function}
We optimize a cross-entropy loss computed only on labeled nodes:

\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = -\frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}_L|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{V}_L}y_i\log(\hat{y}_i) + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i)
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{V}_L$ is the set of labeled nodes, $y_i$ is the ground truth label, and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability. While only labeled nodes contribute to the loss, the message-passing mechanism allows information to flow through the entire graph, enabling unlabeled nodes to assist in representation learning.

\section{Experiments and Results}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Datasets}
\label{subsec:datasets}

We evaluate DynGraph-GAT on two benchmark datasets from FakeNewsNet\cite{shu2020fakenewsnet}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PolitiFact}: Contains 624 real and 432 fake political news articles.
    \item \textbf{GossipCop}: Consists of 16,817 real and 5,323 fake entertainment news.
\end{itemize}

Both datasets provide ground truth labels verified by professional fact-checkers, making them ideal for evaluating fake news detection models.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
\label{subsec:setup}

We implement the N-way-K-shot framework with N=2 (real/fake) and K ranging from 3 to 16 samples per class. For each K, we randomly sample K real and K fake news from the training set, with the remaining samples used as unlabeled data. All test samples are used for evaluation.

The RoBERTa-base model is used for extracting document representations with 768-dimensional feature vectors. For the GAT model, we use a hidden dimension of 64 with 8 attention heads in the first layer. We train with Adam optimizer (learning rate=0.0001) and early stopping with a patience of 20 epochs.

\subsection{Baseline Methods}
\label{subsec:baselines}

We compare our approach with several baselines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MLP: A multi-layer perceptron using RoBERTa embeddings
    \item LSTM: A sequential model over RoBERTa token embeddings
    \item BERT: Fine-tuned BERT for classification
    \item RoBERTa: Pre-trained RoBERTa model for classification
    \item GAT (KNN-5): GAT with KNN edge construction (k=5)
    \item GraphSAGE: GraphSAGE model with same graph structure\cite{hamilton2017inductive}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main Results}
\label{subsec:results}

Tables~\ref{tab:gossipcop_results} and~\ref{tab:politifact_results} present the F1 scores of different models across varying K-shot settings on the GossipCop and PolitiFact datasets, respectively. Our analysis reveals several key findings:

\textbf{GossipCop Dataset Results:} As shown in Table 1, our DynGraph-GAT with dynamic threshold (DTH) consistently outperforms fixed KNN-based graph construction, particularly in low-resource scenarios (K=3--8). At K=3, DynGraph-GAT achieves 0.38 F1 score, compared to 0.32 for both BERT and MLP. The model demonstrates stable performance across different K values, with performance advantages most prominent in extremely few-shot scenarios (K=3--6). This stability aligns with our goal of enabling fake news detection in resource-constrained environments.

\textbf{PolitiFact Dataset Results:} Table 2 shows that DynGraph-GAT achieves superior performance on the PolitiFact dataset, particularly in few-shot scenarios. At K=3, our model achieves 0.67 F1 score, significantly outperforming BERT (0.20) and RoBERTa (0.24). The model maintains consistent performance across different K values, with F1 scores ranging from 0.44 to 0.70, demonstrating robust generalization capabilities.

\textbf{Comparison of Graph-Based Approaches:} Our analysis of different graph-based methods reveals the effectiveness of our approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GAT with Dynamic Threshold vs. KNN:} Our DynGraph-GAT with dynamic threshold consistently outperforms GAT with fixed KNN (k=5) across both datasets. On GossipCop, DynGraph-GAT maintains stable performance (0.32--0.47 F1) while KNN-based GAT shows significant degradation (0.30--0.47 F1). On PolitiFact, DynGraph-GAT achieves higher average performance (0.44--0.70 F1) compared to KNN-based GAT (0.40--0.65 F1), with more consistent results across different K values.
    \item \textbf{GAT vs. GraphSAGE:} The comparison between GAT and GraphSAGE highlights the importance of attention mechanisms. GraphSAGE shows unstable performance with frequent drops to 0.0 F1 score, particularly in low-resource scenarios. In contrast, our GAT approach maintains more stable performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of attention-based message passing in few-shot scenarios.
    \item \textbf{Edge Construction Impact:} The dynamic threshold strategy proves more effective than fixed KNN across both architectures. For example, on PolitiFact at K=3, GAT with dynamic threshold achieves 0.67 F1 score, while GAT with KNN achieves 0.61 F1 score. This improvement is more pronounced in low-resource scenarios, validating our hypothesis that adaptive edge construction better handles varying data distributions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Comparison with Traditional Methods:} Across both datasets, our approach shows clear advantages over traditional methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item MLP and LSTM models show unstable performance with varying K values
    \item BERT and RoBERTa perform better but still lag behind our approach in few-shot scenarios
    \item Our graph-based approach maintains more consistent performance across different data distributions
\end{itemize}

These results validate our key contributions: (1) dynamic threshold edge construction provides more stable performance than fixed KNN approaches, (2) the combination of RoBERTa embeddings with GAT effectively captures semantic relationships in few-shot scenarios, and (3) our approach maintains consistent performance across different data distributions and resource constraints.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present the first pure content-based graph neural network framework for few-shot fake news detection through node classification, eliminating dependency on user propagation data or heterogeneous graph structures. 

Our work establishes a new paradigm for content-based fake news detection through three fundamental contributions:

\textbf{1. Dynamic Threshold Graph Construction:} We demonstrate that adaptive edge formation based on semantic similarity statistics ($\mu + \alpha\sigma$) outperforms fixed KNN approaches by 4.1\% F1-score, particularly in extreme few-shot scenarios (3-8 samples per class). This method adapts to varying data distributions while preventing hub node formation.

\textbf{2. RoBERTa-GAT Synergy:} The integration of RoBERTa embeddings with graph attention networks achieves 0.67 F1-score with 3-shot learning on PolitiFact, significantly outperforming BERT (0.20) and RoBERTa (0.24) baselines. The attention mechanism effectively amplifies discriminative semantic patterns in low-resource settings.

\textbf{3. Transductive Learning Framework:} Our approach leverages unlabeled nodes during message passing while maintaining privacy preservation.

Three key insights emerge from our analysis: First, semantic incongruities between entity relationships within news content provide reliable authenticity signals. Second, dynamic graph sparsification improves information flow in sparse data environments by 4.1\% compared to fixed KNN approaches. Third, our approach maintains stable performance across different data distributions and resource constraints.

Future directions include: (1) Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for semantic edge construction, where LLMs can provide rich semantic relationships between news articles beyond simple embedding similarity, (2) Exploring contrastive learning with LLM-generated positive/negative pairs to improve edge quality, and (3) Developing inductive learning strategies that can generalize to unseen news domains without retraining. This work demonstrates that content-centric GNNs can become frontline defenses against AI-generated disinformation, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications common to island communities.

\section{Future Work}
While DynGraph-GAT demonstrates strong performance in few-shot fake news detection using solely content-based features, several promising research directions could further enhance its capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inductive Learning Framework:} Developing an inductive variant of DynGraph-GAT that can generalize to completely unseen news articles without retraining, improving real-time applicability for detecting emerging misinformation.
    \item \textbf{LLM-Enhanced Edge Construction:} Leveraging Large Language Models to generate richer semantic relationships between news articles beyond simple embedding similarity, potentially capturing more nuanced patterns of misinformation.
    \item \textbf{Explainability Mechanisms:} Integrating attention visualization techniques that highlight influential document relationships and feature attribution methods to identify linguistic patterns indicative of misinformation, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Domain Evaluation:} Testing on multilingual fake news datasets and across different domains (e.g., political to health misinformation) to assess broader generalizability of the approach.
\end{itemize}

These future directions aim to address current limitations while extending DynGraph-GAT's applicability across diverse real-world scenarios.
